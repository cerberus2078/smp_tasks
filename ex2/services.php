          <h1>Concerts</h1>
          <p>A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience.[1] The performance may be by a single
            musician,
            sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble,
            such as an orchestra, choir, or band. Concerts are held in a wide variety and size of settings,
            from private houses and small nightclubs, dedicated concert halls,
            amphitheatres and parks,
            to large multipurpose buildings, such as arenas and stadiums.
            Indoor concerts held in the largest venues are sometimes called arena concerts or amphitheatre concerts.
            Informal names for a concert include show and gig.</p>
